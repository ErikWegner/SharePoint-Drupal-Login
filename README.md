# SharePoint-Drupal-Login

In SharePoint 2013, you now have the ability to create apps for SharePoint. Apps don't actually install on the SharePoint server, but live on another hosting platform, e.g. a Drupal site on a LAMP stack.

This module is a connector that allows a SharePoint user to log in to a Drupal site.
